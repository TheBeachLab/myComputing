# My Computing
 
This is how I do my full-time Linux computing now:

- [Arch Linux](arch.md)
- [Awesome CLI](cli.md)
- [Awesome GUI](gui.md)
- [Daily Linux tasks](daily.md)
- [Network in Linux](network.md)
- [Audio in Linux](audio.md)
- [Video in Linux](video.md)
- [My hardware in Linux](hardware.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

And things that I still need [TODO](TODO.md)
