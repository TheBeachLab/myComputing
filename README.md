# My Computing
How I do my computing

## The Operating System
I started using Linux distributions in the mid 90's. In the age of Windows 95 -still rocking the floppy disks- I was experimenting with Red Hat Linux and Debian. In 2004 I moved to Mac OS X and it was cool for a while. But then in 2013, I realised I was trapped. I became an Apple Victim. I needed to buy the iPhone to be compatible with the Macbook Pro and also the play music with iTunes and iThis and iThat and iWantedtogetthef@ckoutofthere. So fed up of the lack of freedom, I went back to Linux. I am now using Arch Linux, a rolling release distribution. And I think I will stay like this for a while. Arch Linux is not for beginners though.

## The Window Manager
I used XFCE for a long time with compiz. It is very lightweight and it has many cool effects. But maybe biased from my 8-bit age, I use mostly command line tools. For that reason I swapped my window manager to i3wm.
