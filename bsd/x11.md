# Welcome BSD

I decided to try GhoshBSD based on FreeBSD because I am starting to feel that Linux distros are slowly diverging from the Unix philosophy. I understand most of the people are fine with systemd but I just want more simplicity and control over the whole OS.

I liked the first impression, feels fast and stable. So far all the programs I need are there, so I will give it a try. My goal is to have:

- Ly display manager
- bspwm window manager although I maybe try something simple like mwm
- Polybar
- Picom
- Some application launcher (still unsure)
